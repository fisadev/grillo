Grillo
======

A small tool to easily send data (files, clipboard) between computers with 0 config, just using audio and mic.

Installation
============

On Ubuntu, install it by cloning the repo and then running this inside the repo folder and with **a virtualenv** active (yes, ugly, still hasn't been published because it's under development):


.. code::

    sudo apt install portaudio19-dev libffi-dev libsndfile1 xclip
    pip install -e .


Usage
=====


.. code::

    machine1> grillo listen

    machine2> grillo text "hello world!"


After hearing some hight pitched sounds, machine1 should print:


.. code::

    machine1> grillo listen
    Received text:
    hello world!


You can also send files:

.. code::

    machine2> grillo file /path/to/a_file.txt


Or even update machine1's clipboard with machine2's clipboard contents:

.. code::

    machine2> grillo clipboard


This is currently under heavy development, that's why it hasn't been published to PyPI.
**The** biggest issue right now: the tool used to communicate, can't send packages more than 32 bytes long. Possible alternative we are working on: replace it with `this <https://github.com/romanz/amodem>`_ other tool.
